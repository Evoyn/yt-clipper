# What we've done

A running, readable log of completed features — **newest first**. Each session appends a dated entry here when a feature is finished (alongside the detailed `handoffs/`, which are gitignored). This file is committed so you can read it any time.

## 2026-06-28 — v1 complete (M0–M8), one autonomous `/loop` run

Took the project from post-M6 caption work to **functionally complete v1**. Everything below is committed (13 commits); ship with `git push origin main`. All 111 unit tests pass and every feature was live-verified on real Indonesian gaming VODs.

- **Output organization + generated titles** — each clip lands in `workspace/<creator>/<stream-title>/`, named by a catchy ≤60-char title the LLM judge writes from the transcript, so re-promotes never overwrite. Intermediates moved under `data/`. (ADR 0015)
- **Karaoke-fill caption genre** + caption-style **selection** — pick huge-word / rolling-pop / karaoke-fill globally, per-Creator, or per-Clip in the editor.
- **Per-Creator defaults** (`creators.json`) — a streamer's caption style is remembered and pre-selected next import. (ADR 0016)
- **Japanese captions** — character-chunk grouping, so EN / ID / **JA** all caption end-to-end.
- **Re-import restores your work** — detected Moments + their transcripts + LLM reasons reload from `project.json` + `review.json`, no re-detect.
- **No-speech promote no longer crashes** — a silent clip used to abort whisper's DTW; now it just renders without captions.
- **Batch render** — a headless `--batch <vod> [lang] [genre] [k]` mode + a GUI multi-select "Render N selected (auto-framed)" queue, rendering Shorts sequentially.
- **Multi-word dialect corrections** — the correction dict now handles phrases ("point blank" → "Point Blank"), not just single words. (ADR 0014)
- **Release build verified** — `scripts\build-release.bat` produces the fast optimized binaries.

(Earlier milestones M0–M6 — skeleton, YouTube ingest, detection ensemble, arousal + LLM-judge signals, auto-framing — predate this run; see `docs/ROADMAP.md`.)
